## Installation
Clone the repository from Github.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Srivijayaraghav-S/opt_prod_search.git
```
## Optimised Product Search Algorithm (C++)
Uses a B-Tree to store the products, a Priority Queue to extract the top 10 search results, and a Segment Tree to provide price-and-rating-filtered output.
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o search_algo search_algo.cpp
```
## Starting up the NodeJs Server
Start up the local server to host the e-commerce website.
```bash
node server.js
```
## Future Development Ideas
- Updating website user interface
- Making price and rating filters optional
- Incorporate results for non-space-demarcated inputs as well
